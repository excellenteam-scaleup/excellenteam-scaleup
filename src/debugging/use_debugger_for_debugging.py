# Use pdb to do the following instructions -
# Setup - download pycharm
# 0. Add a breakpoint in the return line, inside the top_student function inside the Course class.
# 1. Continue to the next line using the button
# 2. Continue to the next line using the shortcut
# 3. Continue to the next occurrence of the breakpoint
# 4. Add a breakpoint at the beginning of the main function
# 5. Arrive inside the average property using keyboard shortcuts only
# 6. While debugging, create a variable called new_student and assign it a new Student called mark without grades (use evaluate expression)
# 7.while debugging, add the new student to the students attribute, inside the current course object.
# 8. Change marks name to rob
# 9. View all the breakpoints you have set up so far
# 10. Disable (don't delete) the first one you have created.
# 11. Run the program again and add course and student to the watch
# 12. Create a conditional breakpoint somewhere in the code that stops only when the student's name is "Dave"
# 13. Disable all your breakpoints,put your cursor on the last line of code and run you program to the cursor using
# a single command.
